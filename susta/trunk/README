SUSTA
Sustainable web application evinroment
--------------------------------------

Overview
--------

This is a brief readme of an enviroment being built for a web app adressing 
basic human resource needs. The workflow has been thought to provide a 
reasonably simple and uncluttered user experience. 
Design sure leave a lot to be desired, but it should meet the modularity 
and usability a *nix user is acquainted with.

System Requirements
-------------------
System requirements are met by those needed by the individual 
software applications needed to run susta.
The original platform of the development was able to run:

* Apache 2.x
* PHP 4.3
* MySQL 3.3
* OpenOffice.org 2.0.x (if PDF output is desired)

Later versions of the above ones may need some tweaking, in general they 
just runs with no issues. The resource usage is the result of the 
combination of the programs running together. OpenOffice is probably the 
component with the more impact.

Also others, software maybe used. In particular, I've run - although not 
fully tested - those:

* lighttpd
* PHP 5
* MySQL 4


Installation
