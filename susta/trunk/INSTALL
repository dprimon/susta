Very Basic Install instructions
-------------------------------

1. Place the php sources files under www/ directory of your webserver (Apache
   is used in development)
2. Feed a database with sample data provided in file susta.sql.bz2. You may use
   either command line mysql tools or phpmyadmin interface. The latter is 
   suggested for database manipulation. mysql-query-browser should do too.
3. Have a look at include/config.inc.php. These file contains application wide
   system settings. If those are not correct you can easily expect a non 
   working app. Given that, some variables here may need to be properly set to 
   match your installation. Comments are lacking there, but it  should be quite
   straightforward.
4. Support for PDF generation is provided through a dedicated OpenOffice.org   
   instance running in background. Some packages and scripts are needed to 
   achieve that in addition to control over start/stop of the service being 
   provided. Expect more info on that soon.
