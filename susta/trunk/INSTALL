Very Basic Install instructions
-------------------------------

1. Place the php sources files under www/ directory of your webserver (Apache
   is used in development, lighttpd seems to work too)
2. Create and populate a database with sample data provided in file 
   sample_db/susta.sql.bz2.
   You may use either command line mysql tools or the phpmyadmin web interface.
   mysql-query-browser may come handy after installation for record manipulation.
   Here is a way to install the db named susta supposing you're using mysql from 
   the bash prompt

	daniele@bee:/var/www/susta/sample_db# (cat <<SQL ; bzcat susta.sql.bz2 \
	 ; cat <<SQL2) | mysql -uyourusername -p
	CREATE DATABASE susta;
	USE susta;
	SQL
	SHOW TABLES;
	SQL2

   Type the above code replacing yourusername with the username of the database
   you intend to adopt. You'll be asked a password then if loading has been
   succesfull you'll see a list of tables just created, like that:

	Tables_in_susta
	d-anagrafica
	d-formazione
	d-storico
	d_anagrafica_seq
	d_formazione_seq
	d_storico_seq
	s-qualifiche
	s-reparti
	s-ruoli


3. Have a look at include/config.inc.php. These file contains application wide
   system settings. If those are not correct you can easily expect a non 
   working app. Given that, some variables here may need to be properly set to 
   match your installation. Comments are straightforward.

4. Support for PDF generation is provided through a dedicated OpenOffice.org   
   instance running in background (tipically on a xvfb virtual framebuffer xserver).
   The setup includes a macro for OpenOffice Writer and an rc.d/ script which preloads
   the xvfb server with an instance of OpenOffice Writer.
   See the wiki http://susta.wiki.sourceforge.net/ with instructions that covers a
   Debian setup.
